# Visual Selection
The project is an attempt of practical application of 
artificial neural networks. With use of camera as sensor and arduino board 
it is possible to activate a servomotor based on visual input from the camera. 
Classifier is and CNN-type neural network MobileNet pretrained on 
imagenet dataset, fine tuned on 64 images 224x224 taken by the camera.
