# Visual Selection
The project is a practical application of artificial neural networks.
With use of camera as sensor and arduino board it is possible to activate
a servomotor based on visual input from the camera. Classifier is and CNN-type
neural network MobileNet pretrained on imagenet dataset, fine tuned on 64
images 224x224 taken by the camera.
